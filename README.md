# Path_finding_visualizer
Author: Terry Li

This project visualizes pathfinding algorithms through a game BomberMan. 
This game involves a map with randomly distributed walls on it. 
The players can move and place a bomb, which will exploit and hurt other players or destroy the walls. 
Players have many props which can increase hp or upgrade their bombs. 
This game has two modes: 2 players mode (press ‘9’) and AI mode (press ‘0’).

To run the project, run:
`python3 main.py`

Make sure to install pygame library.

Shortcut commands: press ‘p’ to pause / unpause, if the game is over, press ‘r’ to restart. 
Other basic commands can be found by clicking ‘help’ on the first interface or just directly click on bottons.
